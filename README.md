# Docker-Rkt
This is a detailed comparative study that provides quantitative and qualitative assessment of supported functionality, performance and container clustering between Docker and Rkt. Since currently there exists no such detailed study. In this project we answer questions like, hat are the performance implications on Network, CPU and IO when running Docker versus rkt? How do these ACs behave in distributed big data processing? How do distributed web applications perform when containerized? Which of the two ACs should be preferred for software development, for a given set of requirements? To avoid a vendor lock-in, which of the two ACs must be chosen and why? Performing customizations and implementing additional support is easier in which one of the two ACs? How do these technologies compare in distributed environments? What is the overall support by popular cloud providers? What solutions are available for container clustering and scheduling?
